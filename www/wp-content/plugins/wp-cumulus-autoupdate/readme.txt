This plugin attaches itself to upgrade process of WP-Cumulus plugin, so every time you update WP-Cumulus it will automatically re-download `tagcloud.swf` with Serbian latin and cyrillic letters, so you don't have to worry about them being lost with each update of WP-Cumulus.

Only for ex-Yugoslavian bloggers ;)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Isn't it stupid to make plugin for another plugin? =

It might be, but this is very light and unobtrusive plugin which runs even if not activated (but if you want it to automatically runs each time you update WP-Cumulus you should activate it).
