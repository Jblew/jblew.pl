	- Avoid errors on attempting to send data to the client
	  if they were disconnected during a read

	  and a proxy-debug binary with full debug
	- Ignore blank lines in host and deny list files, don't
	  complain about them
	- Change ClientAddr to be a doubly linked list, that's
	  where the lockups are happening

0.16:

	- Added easy Makefile method of disabling debugging info
	- Added a log_dbg macro that requires macro varargs,
	  allows compilation out the debug statements

0.14:

	- Added tons of asserts
	- Added debug log type
	- Small cleanups
	- Added a bunch of debug messages

0.13:

	  make root-owned log and pid files
	- Remove USE_IPV6 build-time option

0.12:

	- Fix infinite loop when socket() fails in connect_to_server

	- Enhanced option parsing

0.07:

	- Cleanup of main(), split into several functions
	- Create both an IPv4 and IPv6 address, so IPv4 clients

	- Added a -6 <bool> option for configuration IPv6 runtime
	  support

0.06:

	- Better build configuration
	- Improved logging system
	- Print copyright/license notice on startup
	- Improve formatting of IPv6 host/port pairs
