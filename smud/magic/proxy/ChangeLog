0.92:
	
	- Allow specifying of host to bind server socket to.
	- Remove IPv4/IPv6-specific login in
	  create_listen_sock().
	- Use only one server socket.

0.91:

	- Avoid errors on attempting to send data to the client
	  if they were disconnected during a read
	- Don't require the POLLOUT flag to attempt to send out

	  better performance
	  
0.90:

	- Fix linked list setup in client_add()
	- Automatically strip the proxy (non-debug) binary

0.17:

	- Updated Makefile to build a proxy binary with no debug,
	  and a proxy-debug binary with full debug
	- Ignore blank lines in host and deny list files, don't
	  complain about them
	- Change ClientAddr to be a doubly linked list, that's
	  where the lockups are happening

0.16:

	- Added easy Makefile method of disabling debugging info
	- Added a log_dbg macro that requires macro varargs,
	  allows compilation out the debug statements

0.15:

	- Added more debug messages

0.14:

	- Added tons of asserts
	- Added debug log type
	- Small cleanups
	- Added a bunch of debug messages

0.13:

	  make root-owned log and pid files
	- Remove USE_IPV6 build-time option

0.12:

	- Fix infinite loop when socket() fails in connect_to_server

0.11:

	- Added maximum allowed clients per host (option -m, default 3)
	- Enhanced option parsing

0.07:

	- Cleanup of main(), split into several functions
	- Create both an IPv4 and IPv6 address, so IPv4 clients
	  on an IPv6 enabled server are handled as IPv4
	- Build with IPv6 support by default
	- Added a -6 <bool> option for configuration IPv6 runtime
	  support

0.06:

	- Better build configuration
