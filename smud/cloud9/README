 Cloud9 is a web-based MUD client.  Unlike other web-based clients, Cloud9
 makes limited use of Java(tm).  An applet is employed only for handling the
 low level networking which JavaScript cannot handle in a portable manner.

 The entire rest of the client is implemented using JavaScript and Dynamic
 HTML.

 Cloud9 aims to supply a solid basic MUD client for the average MUD server
 and to provide complete ZMP support with many interesting packages for
 greatly enhanced play on compatible servers, such as AweMUD.

 In order to run Cloud9, you need only visit a website that has installed
 Cloud9.  You cannot run Cloud9 on your own computer due to the security
 restrictions of Java(tm) applet networking.

 Cloud9 should work on any browser that supports Java(tm) applets and
 the JSObject (aka LiveConnect!) interface.  JVM 1.4.2 or higher is
 required.  The latest version of the Sun JVM can be found at 
   http://java.sun.com

 Some browsers may not have the Java(tm) plugin installed, may have an 
 older and incompatible version of the JVM, or may have either Java(tm)
 or JavaScript disabled.  These features must be re-enabled before Cloud9
 can run in those browsers.

 Cloud9 supports any text-based game utilizing telnet and line mode
 input.  (Character mode input is not supported, yet.)  Basic ANSI
 color escapes and clear screen escapes are also supported.  Cursor
 movement escapes are not and likely will not be supported.

 ZMP support is not yet available, though it will be created before
 the first official release.

 All features aside from the low-level telnet code are in JavaScript,
 and adding any new features or UI is very, very simple.  ZMP allows
 the creation of rich clients that can interact in novel and useful
 ways with the MUD server.

 AwesomePlay Productions, Inc. looks forward to seeing what new
 features and abilities the community can create using the Cloud9
 client framework.
